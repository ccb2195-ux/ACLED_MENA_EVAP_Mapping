                <h2>The Worst Crackdown on Protesters in a Decade</h2>
                <p>Due to a sharply declining currency, a series of protests sprung up across Iran which would eventually
                    lead to a nation-wide internet blackout, and an unprecedented wave of attacks on protesters. 
                    The Iranian political establishment had weathered protests like this before 
                    (like the Women, Life, and Freedom Movement from 2023), though something was different this time. </p>

                <p>On January 8th, 2026, the Iranian government launched a full-scale internet blackout;
                    a smokescreen which would provide cover for the regime's relentless assault on protesters
                    around the country. The scale of the crackdown shocked the world, with photos and videos 
                    slowly trickling out of Iran through hidden networks and satellite uploads, 
                    with <a href="https://time.com/7357635/more-than-30000-killed-in-iran-say-senior-officials/">Time</a>
                    recently reporting that the death toll could be as high as 30,000. 

This timeline shows the frequency of excessive force incidents against protesters across the MENA region from 2016 to present.</p>

                <p>While the Iranian people are no strangers to government violence, the current round of crackdowns
                represents a roughly 300% increase in violent incidents recorded against protesters compared to the
                last high-water-mark in November of 2022. </p>
                <p> <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2026/01/what-happened-at-the-protests-in-iran/">Amnesty International</a>
                 reports that the Iran security forces engaged protesters with small arms, mass arrests, and disappearances
                 across all of Iran's 31 provinces. Amnesty was able to confirm at least one hospital was operating a makeshift morgue,
                with at least 205 unique body bags. </p>

                <p>This visualization uses data from the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED), with the largest limitation being ACLED's own Peaceful Protesting data. This project was meant to show how the 2025-26 Iran Protests compared to the last decade of protests in the region.</p>
                <p>The map specifically focuses on incidents classified as "Excessive force against protesters" within the Middle East and North Africa region, though there are other significant confounding categories that could contribute to this analysis.</p>
